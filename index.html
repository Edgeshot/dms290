    <h2>Lore</h2>
    <p>A legend based on oral traditions holds that Lahore, known in ancient times as shadipuri (City of Lava in Sanskrit), was founded by Prince Lava, the son of Sita and Rama (Hindu Mythology); To this day, Lahore Fort has a vacant Lava temple
      dedicated to Lava (also pronounced Loh, hence Loh-awar or "The Fort of Loh")</p>
    <h2>Historic value</h2>
    <p>Known as the Mughal City of Gardens, it’s hard not to see the influence of the Mughals in Lahore’s culture and architecture. There’s the Lahore Fort or Shahi Qila, which was built during the Mughal Emperor Akbar’s reign and has been regulary
      upgraded by all the subsequent rulers.Then there’s the iconic Badshahi Mosque, which alongside the Minar-e-Pakistan is synonymous with Lahore. One of the largest mosques in the world, the Badshahi Mosque can accommodate over 55,000 worshipers
      and has been a major tourist attraction for a long time. But Lahore isn’t just about large Mughal buildings. Taking a walk around the Old City or Androon Shehr, you can find remnants from times when the Rajputs and Sikhs ruled over the city.
      And there’s a good amount of influence from the thieving British as well but it’s not as beautiful.
    </p>
    <h2>Culture</h2>
    <p>There’s a reason Lahore is known as the cultural hub of Pakistan. The people of Lahore celebrate several festivals throughout the year which allows for the city to remain lively. In addition to the Eid festivals, Lahore is also renowned for
      Basant, the Festival of Lamps or Mela Chiraghan, the National Horse and Cattle show, Pakistan Army and Pakistan Airforce parades, and others. Basically, there are a lot of celebrations that go on in Lahore which allow for a lively and diverse
      culture to flourish in the city.</p>
    <h2>Food capital of Pakistan</h2>
    <p>Ask any Lahori and they’ll tell you that there’s no better place for food in Pakistan than Lahore. With historic places such as Gawal Mandi and Anarkali to more modern establishments in places like MM Alam Road, Lahore is beaming with
      countless dining options</p>
    <h2>Education</h2>
    <p>Lahore has historically been a very intellectual city. And fortunately, that hasn’t changed over time. Known also as the education capital of Pakistan, Lahore has more colleges and universities than any other city in Pakistan.</p>
    <h2>Sports</h2>
    <p>Another thing Lahore is well known for is sports. In addition to the sporting spirit, Lahore also has several world class venues. In the past, Lahore hosted the 1996 Cricket World Cup final and 1990 Hockey World Cup final. In addition, all the
      major sports governing bodies are headquartered in Lahore. In addition to stadiums, Lahore also has several country clubs which cater to the sporting nature of the lively city.</p>
    <h2>Fashion forward</h2>
    <p>Most of Pakistan’s fashion industry is based in Lahore with renowned designers such as Hassan Sheheryar Yasin, Karma, Qasim Yar Tiwana, Khawar Riaz and several others. More so, Lahore is also home to some of Pakistan’s important fashion
      institutions such as the Lahore School of Fashion Design and Pakistan Institue of Fashion and Design. And then there’s also Lahore’s Fashion Week.</p>
    <h2>Family playground</h2>
    <p>Not only is Lahore a lively place for adults, but also for children (to the relief of many parents). From Sinbad to Battlefield to Joy Land to Wonder World, kids are sure to enjoy themselves in all these places. Moreover, Lahore is also home
      to the Lahore Zoo which happens to be second oldest zoo in South Asia.</p>
    <h2>Performing Arts</h2>
    <p>There are several theaters in Lahore that promote performing arts but none has helped preserve art and entertainment industry as much as the grand Alhamra Arts Complex. Alhamra is a large venue that consists of several theaters and
      amphitheaters. Lahore also plays host to World Performing Arts Festival which is a ten day festival of musical, theater, concernts, dance, mine and puppetry shows.</p>
    <h2>City of Gardens</h2>
    <p>Another name given to Lahore is the City of Gardens. Many of the gardens in Lahore were built during the Mughal era and fortunately, many of them have survived the test of time. From Shalimar Garden built by Shah Jehan to Jilani Park aka Race
      Course Park to Bagh-e-Jinnah, Lahore lives up to its name as the City of Gardens.</p>
    <h2>The People</h2>
    <p>With their music, festivals, parties, music, language, art, literature, cuisines and what not, Lahoris are a unique breed. Like many other places in Pakistan, Lahoris are also known for being very hospitable. But Lahoris take hospitality to
      the next level and go out of their way to make you feel at home while having a great time – they’ll put your comfort before their own.</p>
